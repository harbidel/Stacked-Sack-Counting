# Stacked Sack Counting
Counting of Stacked sacks using Computer Vision

## Procedure
* Collect images of stacked sacks: You will need a variety of images of stacked sacks in different orientations and lighting conditions.
* Preprocess the images: This may involve resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and removing noise.
* Use a computer vision algorithm to count the number of sacks: There are a number of different algorithms that you can use, such as edge detection, object detection, and image segmentation.
* Evaluate the results: Once you have counted the number of sacks in the images, you need to evaluate the results to make sure that they are accurate.

### Here are some of the computer vision algorithms that you can use to count the number of stacked sacks:

* Edge detection: This algorithm identifies the edges in an image. The number of edges can be used to estimate the number of sacks in the image.
* Object detection: This algorithm identifies objects in an image. The number of objects can be used to estimate the number of sacks in the image.
* Image segmentation: This algorithm divides an image into different segments. The number of segments can be used to estimate the number of sacks in the image.
