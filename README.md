# Stacked Sack Counting
Counting of Stacked sacks using Computer Vision

## Procedure
* Collect images of stacked sacks: You will need a variety of images of stacked sacks in different orientations and lighting conditions.
* Preprocess the images: This may involve resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and removing noise.
* Use a computer vision algorithm to count the number of sacks: There are a number of different algorithms that you can use, such as edge detection, object detection, and image segmentation.
* Evaluate the results: Once you have counted the number of sacks in the images, you need to evaluate the results to make sure that they are accurate.
